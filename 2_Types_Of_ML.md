# ___Three Types of Machine learning techniques___
1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Reinforcement learning

- ##  _Supervised Machine Learning_
Supervised ML is used when there is dependent feature(output) in data, the goal of algorithm is to correctly map the input with output.  i.e Predict the output

For ex: predicting house prices from data containing `house size`, `num of rooms` (Both independent feature) and `price` (dependent feature (output))

___Two types of cases where Supervised ML is used___:
1. __Classification__: predicting descrete labels or categories  
used in: email fraud dectection, predicting pass/fail etc  
- Two types:   
`Binary Classification` (only two ouputs: Pass/Fail)  
`Multiclass classification` (more that two outputs)



- ## _Unsupervised Machine Learning_
In this branch of Ml, we do not have any specific label or output, instead the model/algorithm works on pattern, cluster recognition to help making conclusions  
used in: Data analysis, understanding customers and patterns, etc


- ## _Reinforcements Learning_
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns how to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Instead of being trained on labeled data (as in supervised learning) or finding patterns in unlabeled data (as in unsupervised learning), the agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.
