## Welcome to My Machine Learning resource  

This repository was originally created as my personal learning path for mastering machine learning, but it can also serve as a helpful reference for others.  
Currently, it focuses on **supervised learning algorithms**, and I’ll keep expanding it with other algorithms and concepts as I progress.  

The purpose of this repository is to **document everything I learn**,both theory and practical implementation in jupyter notebooks. It’s meant to be:  
- A structured record of my ML journey  
- A quick reference for concepts and examples that I will surely need for future projects


## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized by machine learning topics, each with explanatory notes and code implementations:  

- `1_Introduction.md` → Basics of Machine Learning  
- `2_Types_Of_ML.md` → Types of ML (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement) 
- `3_Sklearns_design.ipynb` → Explains Estimator,Transformer,Predictor
- `End_To_End_Project1/` → Complete ML pipeline project using california housing dataset 
- `3_Classification/` → Classification algorithms and examples using mnist dataset 
- `4_LinearRegression/` → Linear Regression concepts and implementations  
- `5_Logistic_Regression/` → Logistic Regression models  
- `6_SVMs/` → Support Vector Machines  
- `7_Decision_Trees/` → Decision Trees  
- `8_Ensemble_Learning/` → Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.  
- `9_Dimensionality/` → PCA, SVD, and other dimensionality reduction techniques  


## Installation and Usage  
Follow these steps to run the notebooks on your local machine:  


```bash
## 1. Clone the repository
